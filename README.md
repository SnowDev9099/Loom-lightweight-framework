# Loom Language

## Introduction
Welcome to Loom, a lightweight and intuitive programming language designed for simplicity and versatility. Loom offers a rich set of features to support various programming tasks, from basic arithmetic operations to advanced functionalities like function definitions and logging. This comprehensive documentation will guide you through the language syntax and its capabilities.

## Features Overview
Let's dive into the key features of the Loom language:

### 1. Arithmetic Operations
Loom supports standard arithmetic operations, allowing you to perform calculations effortlessly.

Example:

result = 5 + 3
result = 10 - 2
result = 6 * 4
result = 20 / 5

### 2. Function Definitions
Define custom functions to encapsulate reusable blocks of code, enhancing code organization and modularity.

Example:

function add(a, b) = (
    return a + b
)

### 3. Variable Assignments
Assign values to variables for storage and manipulation, enabling dynamic data handling in your programs.

Example:

x = 10
name = "John"
is_valid = true

### 4. Loops
Execute code blocks repeatedly using loop constructs, facilitating iterative processes and tasks.

Example:

loop(5) (
    debug.system.log.log("Loop iteration")
)


### 5. Placeholders
Dynamically substitute values into expressions with placeholders, offering flexibility and dynamic behavior in your code.

Example:

result = add(placeholder(), 5)


### 6. Logging
Print messages of different types (log, warning, or error) for debugging purposes, aiding in code troubleshooting and development.

Example:

debug.system.log.log("This is a log message")
debug.system.log.warning("This is a warning message")
debug.system.log.error("This is an error message")
